# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-with-Second-Shortest-Path-and-Graph-Visualization
This repository contains a Python script that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find both the shortest and second shortest paths in a weighted graph. The script also visualizes the graph, highlighting both paths, using the NetworkX library and Matplotlib.

Features:
Weighted Graph Creation: Allows users to create a weighted graph by providing the number of vertices, vertex names, and their respective neighbors with weights.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and distance between a specified start and destination vertex.

Second Shortest Path: Finds the second shortest path in the graph by removing edges from the shortest path and running Dijkstra's algorithm on the modified graph.

Graph Visualization: Utilizes NetworkX and Matplotlib to visually represent the weighted graph, highlighting both the shortest and second shortest paths.
