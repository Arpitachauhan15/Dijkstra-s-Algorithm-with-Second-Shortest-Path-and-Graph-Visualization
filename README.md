# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-with-Second-Shortest-Path-and-Graph-Visualization
This repository contains a Python script that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find both the shortest and second shortest paths in a weighted graph. The script also visualizes the graph, highlighting both paths, using the NetworkX library and Matplotlib.
